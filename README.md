The DOLPi is a polarimetric camera that can be used to measure the polarization of light. It consists of a lens, a polarization beam splitter, and a detector. The camera can be used to measure the intensity and polarization of light at the same time. The benefit of a polarimetric camera is that it can be used to study the polarized light from various astronomical objects. This information can be used to learn about the physical properties of those objects, such as their temperature, density, and composition.
